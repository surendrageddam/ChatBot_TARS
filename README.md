# ChatBot_TARS
 Hello Everyone,
 I've created a simple  AI conversational chat bot called "TARS" using Tensorflow. For this project, Ive gathered some chat data from the internet ,here is the link for the said https://github.com/jalizadeh/Chatbot-Dialog-Dataset
 For doing this and to get the main idea I've searched all over the internet and Youtube and found some tutorials in which they used some very basic techniques to preprocessing and training the model. I think using those techniques are not  much stable for training, so, Ive done on my own
 using Word2Vec for preprocessing and training using LSTM which makes the model to understand the context a way much better. Hope you like it.
